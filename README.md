Arc-Darkest is a flat, dark-mode theme with transparent elements, for GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments. Arc-Darkest also has two varieties of matching Icons and Folders.

Arc theme is 2019's most popular theme, as it has been for the past couple of years, according to major sources: (August 2, 2019) https://www.ubuntupit.com/top-15-best-gnome-shell-themes-gnome-desktop/.

The well-embraced standard Arc theme has always been available in the three variants of Arc, Arc-Dark, and Arc-Darker; but, at last, a fourth and measurably even darker dark-Arc has arrived on the GTK+ scene. Even at it dimmest, the earlier Arc variants have never quite satisfied those who need the lights turned down real low, but this fourth variant should fix all of that.

The forth Arc desktop theme darkens only six elements, on the whole, but where it happens makes all the difference. Significantly, keeping the official Arc hues, contrasts, and structure wholly intact was foremost in this project's objective. Thus, nothing is altered one tiny bit in those crucial areas - as the existent, intact, Arc hues are pragmatically darkened.

Moreover, the signature Arc-Blue hue is not darkened or altered in any way via the new Arc-Darkest variant. The goal was invariably to keep Arc as we know it, while merely darkening the elements necessary to align with the brightness values more associated with what heavy users demand from dark themes. We hope we achieved that for you.

***Matching Numix as well as matching Suru++ icons are also available for download here.


Both the Suru++ and the Numix icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the new Arc-Darkest desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

Special thanks to the Numix team for their inspiration, expertise and contributions at: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme. The Suru-grounded icon set was initially designed and developed by Sam Hewitt - under GPL3. The original Suru icon set and concept was created by Matthieu James - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are Andrea Bonanni (original author) and Gustavo Costa . Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by Keefer Rourke - under GPL3/MIT. Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
