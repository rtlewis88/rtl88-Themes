FreshBerry is a new GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell and Cinnamon - Dark Mode Theme that showcases a color scheme requested by a corporate client of the rtl88 team. This firm needed a theme which could be utilized by their entire staff regardless of the condition of their eyes. From the design team, to the sales crew, to the IT folks, to those with accessibility needs, the FreshBerry theme was the color scheme that got the job done for all of them.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of modernized Numix elements, in tandem with those of minimalist artist Rafa Capoci, icon designer Wojciech Kalinowski, and full-stack web-developer/themer Pavel Agarkov, with an overlay of the provided color scheme.


***Matching Numix,  matching GNOME, and matching Suru++ icons are also available for download here.


The Numix, GNOME, and Suru++ icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the new FreshBerry desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

Special thanks to the GNOME team for living up their standards as the benchmark of Linux development; it is always a pleasure to be a part of any work you have advanced. Tremendous thanks to the Numix team for their inspiration, expertise and contributions at: https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme. Much appreciation for the opportunity to further craft the Suru-grounded icon set, which was initially designed and developed by Sam Hewitt - under GPL3. The original Suru icon set and concept was created by Matthieu James - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are Andrea Bonanni (original author) and Gustavo Costa . Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by Keefer Rourke - under GPL3/MIT. Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
