Abyss is a flat, dark-mode theme with a few transparent elements. Abyss is built on a unique, wholly customized platform utilizing a careful blend of both Modern-Numix and Material Design formats. There are plenty of apps, still out there, built on older formats than what Material can correctly handle on its own; this prudent blend, employing Modern-Numix, takes care of all that. Abyss is made to work on GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments. Abyss also has matching Icons and Folders.

The Abyss desktop theme consists of four color palettes made with shades of indigo, oxblood, dark emerald, and deep aquamarine - created for a clean and uncluttered design pattern to achieve optimal focus and readability, and a warm, attractive look.


The Matching Suru++ icons are available for download here.

The four Suru++ icons and folders sets have been carefully crafted to match the four Abyss desktop color schemes, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.

The Suru-grounded icon set was initially designed and developed by Sam Hewitt - under GPL3. The original Suru icon set and concept was created by Matthieu James - Canonical Design Team. Core developers are Andrea Bonanni (original author) and Gustavo Costa . Devices icons are inspired by La Capitaine created by Keefer Rourke - under GPL3/MIT. Emoji icons are derived from the Twenoji created by Twitter Team - under MIT. Some icons are based on Numix mimetypes icons created by the Numix Team - under GPL3. Devices and places icons and several apps icons are inspired by Papirus icons created by Alexey Varfolomeev - under GPL3. Numberless icons are from Gravit Designer, under GPL3/MIT.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
